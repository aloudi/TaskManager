# Task Manager Test

Using Angular.js and ES6, with Gulp and Webpack for the build process on the front-end side, and Express.js with Mongoose and MongoDB for the server. 

## Requirements

- Node and npm
- MongoDB

## Installing
- Clone this repo
- Install dependencies in both folders: `npm install`

## Running the App
#### Back-End
The server requires MongoDB to be running, launch it first with `mongod` in a separate terminal, and then start the server with `npm start`.
#### Front-End
App uses Gulp to build and launch the development environment. Running `npm start` will bundle the app with `webpack`, launch a development server, and watch all files. The port will be displayed in the terminal.
###### Additional information about the front-end setup can be found in the original starter repo at [NG6-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/NG6-starter)
